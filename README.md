# Sentences ðŸ’¬

This is a simple web application I made to display short stories.

## Tools

It's built with [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org) and the content is pulled from [Contentful](https://contentful.com). It is deployed online as a static website thanks to [Surge.sh](https://surge.sh).

The idea of this is to create a website with a fully customizable content without using a traditional CMS. And also to force me to write sometimes...

## Development

Launch local server:
```shell
npm run dev
```

Generate static files:
```shell
npm run generate
```

Deploy on Surge:
```shell
npm run deploy
```
